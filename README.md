# Crop-yield-prediction-using-big-data-technique

- The agriculture industry is changing in recent years due to technological and data analytics breakthroughs, which are enabling data-driven problem solving of real-time issues. Crop yield prediction is one of the key areas where advanced technologies are applied. Based on yield estimates, farmers, the national food security department, policy makers, and stockholders can make educated judgments. It also oversees the best use of resources and the reduction of production-related risks in agriculture.

- Objective:
  To get exposures to big data techniques.\
  To explore Big Query ML of google cloud for yield prediction.\
  To create insightful dashboard for crop yield analysis using Google locker studio and Knowage.\

Algorithm Used:

Linear regression

AutoML regression

Linear regression with L1 regularization
